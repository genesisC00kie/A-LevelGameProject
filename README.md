the SCR file holds my code

This game uses node.js to allow for web server functionality, making it possible for two players using different devices to race eachother.
When hosted on a local device, 2 tabs running the Index.html file can be used to simulate separate devices
I used VScode to program this and used the live server extension to run the Index.html file
