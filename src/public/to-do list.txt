(add first two second power-up to single player mode if time allows, but in fixed positions maybe)

allow players to see the position of their opponent on screen
emit the position to the server
the server sends the opponents position to the client
a second sprite is added with opponents position

when one player finished, make them wait for the other to finish.
when both finish send their score and time to the server, calculate how much time one has than the other.
award more points to the player with lower time
send back to client to display on screen.#

when players finish the stage have both of them removed from the availible players array, set both players to null
and allow two new players to join the game
